# PolyChat AI
Uniting humans and multiple AI models in dynamic, collaborative conversations.

*This project is still a work in progress, more details and features are coming soon.*

## Goal
PolyChat AI is a web-based chatroom platform that enables dynamic interactions between humans and multiple AI language models (LLMs). Our goal is to create a versatile environment where AI models and human users can engage in conversations for various scenarios like board games, brainstorming sessions, and role-playing activities.

## Use Cases
- **Board Games**: Simulate multiplayer board games with AI participants acting as players.
- **Brainstorming Sessions**: Collaborate with multiple AI models to generate ideas and solve problems.
- **Role-Playing**: Engage in immersive role-playing scenarios with AI characters.
- **Educational Discussions**: Facilitate debates or discussions on academic topics.
